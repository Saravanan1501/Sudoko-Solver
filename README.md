# Sudoko-Solver
This is an open-cv code which uses a Convolution Neural Network to classify digits from 0 to 9, using keras for training of the model. It was written from scratch, and is available under the name "myModel". This code takes an unsolved sudoku image as input, processes the image detect the numbers, solves the sudoko puzzle and shows us output at each stages.

Model oputput is avilable in the root repository,
The trained model and sample sudoku image is available inside the resources folder

There are some prerequisite if you want to execute the python code:
**opencv,
Tensorflow and
Numpy**
